# Advanced Backup.sh

The initial script Backup.sh did not seem practical in real life situations as backups should be isolated from the actual data. 
This script copies the directory as a tarball to /tmp (feel free to change to ouput location) and echoes back that the backup has successfully been executed. 

# Backup.sh

A script that stores a backup of the directory as a compressed tarball in my home directory.

# Welcome.sh

A script that uses variables to echo to the user a greeting, the users name, and the day of the week. Plus as an added bonus cowsay states the users bash shell version :)
